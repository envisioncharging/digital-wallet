# ENVISION CHARGING Business Model

We make money on energy sales (% split with property owners) and advertising income across our vast charging network forecast at 45,000 EV Chargers installed by 2025.

Other revenue streams may include micro payments on sales of things like a cup of coffee, clothing, tickets, movies, events, and NFT’s. Purchase from our EV kiosks or mobile app.

Further ad revenue streams are paid sponsor packages that include a sponsored icon on our maps, banner link packages, dedicated apps, API integration, and featured artist campaigns.
 
We will incentivize members to use our EVC Token to earn rewards and access additional features with membership tiers.

# Crypto Payments

ENVISION CHARGING is planning to integrate Crypto payment using XRP (Ripple). 

Customers can purchase products using Envision’s XRP Wallet and EVC Token. 

Ripple is a blockchain-based digital payment network and protocol with its own cryptocurrency, XRP.  

All EVC Token transactions will store in XRPL Ledger. All transactions are public, with strong cryptography to guarantee the integrity of the system. 

Anyone can operate a validator; currently, over 150 validators are active on the ledger, operated by universities, exchanges, businesses, and individuals. Additionally, the consensus protocol ensures the blockchain becomes more decentralized over time as the validator pool grows.

EVC Token is planning to enable Hooks with smart contracts.
